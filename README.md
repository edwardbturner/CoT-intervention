# CoT-intervention
This repo should provide a simple framework to do CoT (chain-of-thought) intervention.

Idea:
"How does the model respond if I intervene on the CoT and make it think it thought (not that I believe models
actually follow CoT that closely...) something misaligned?"

Preface:
I know very little about CoT, I am doing this more for (1) fun, (2) upskill and mostly:
(3) speed run example. You can be way better at mech int, trading, life, ... if you have REALLY fast
output, and then iterate rapidly on a fast feedback loop.
